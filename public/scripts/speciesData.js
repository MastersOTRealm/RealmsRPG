        Name: "Darkin",
        Description: "The Darkin are a mysterious and enigmatic species, distinguished by their pale grey skin and lightish grey hair, often cascading in untamed waves or braids. Their most striking feature, however, lies in their eyes, which commonly come in two distinct hues: a fiery orange that seems to flicker with inner intensity, or a deep, abyssal black that appears to absorb all light around them. With an aura of ancient wisdom and a demeanor veiled in secrecy, the Darkin possess an innate connection to the arcane forces of the world. Their culture is steeped in mysticism and esoteric knowledge, often shrouded in rituals and rites that date back eons. The Darkin are divided into two primary clans, each based on the color of their eyes. The Clan of Oblivion, distinguished by their profound obsidian gaze, and are renowned for their relentless pursuit of esoteric wisdom and mastery over the destructive echelons of arcane arts or combat styles. While some perceive members of the Clan of Oblivion as savages or renegades, such categorization remains subjective. Conversely, the Clan of Eclipse, bedecked with fiery amber eyes, stands as paragons of refinement and societal cohesion, driven by an unyielding quest to attain esteemed status among the diverse speciess of the realm.",
